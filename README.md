# HCIp (Bluetooth HCI parser)
A fully custom Bluetooth Host Controller Interface (HCI) packet parser.

This library and CLI tool will be part of a larger bluetooth related project I am working on. The exact dimensions of the project are not yet decided upon, but a parser will definitely be necessary. Additionally, on a personal level, this will help me understand the protocol better.




# Project status
Not functional yet.

This project is not abandonned. I've realised that a lot of the usefulness will come from embedded. I'm taking a break to learn zephyr
